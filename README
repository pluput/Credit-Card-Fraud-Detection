Looking at Machine Learning Techniques:

Rule-based Approach:
- cannot recognize hidden patterns
- cannot predict fraud by going beyond rules
- canntot respond to new situations, not trained on

Modern alternative (Data Science Approach):
- leverage vast amounts of data and model it in a way that lets us flag or
predict fraud in future transactions
- machine learning, deep neural networks

Machine Learning:
- Supervised Learning:
  - predict values of response variable (regression)
  - predict labels of predefinied cateogries (classification tasks)
  - Types & Issues:
    - data labeling: some labels will be wrong
    - unbalanced data: one class is more frequent than the others, so data is unbalanced
      - <1% are frauds

- Unsupervised Learning:
  - identifies clusters, outliers, or anomalies in the data set
  - Types & Issues:
    - PCA: identify hidden patterns in data
      - reduce number of features for ML, while preserving most important patters of the data
    - K-Means Clustering: find patterns in data using clusters

************** WE WILL BE DOING SUPERVISED LEARNING **************


Our Challenges:

- unbalanced data: 
  - operational efficency
    - have less than 8 seconds to flag a transaction
  - incorrect flagging
  - sampling methods:
    - it could favor majority class, therfore having a large classification error over the fraud cases
    - on training set
      - random over-sampling: copy cases in fraud cases mulitple times till you reach the number you want
      - random under-sampling: remove some of the legitimate cases
      - both: up and down sampling
    - BOTH OF THESE ARE UNDESIRED
    - synthetic minority over-sampling technique:
      - over sample fraud cases by creating sythetic fraud cases
        - say there is a graph where each point is a case (x=amount, y=ration)
        - find k nearest fraudulent neighbor of fraud X
        - randomly choose one of X's nearest neighbor
        - find x, y coordinate of both points
        - synthetic case:
          - x is x1 + rand(0, 1) * (x2-x1)
          - y is y1 + rand(0, 1) * (y2-y1)
        - do this for each point


We will run through our data and try out random over-sampling, random under-sampling, and
synthetic minority over-sampling. We will show the differences through scatterplots and prediction
accuracy.
